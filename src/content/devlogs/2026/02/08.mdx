**Sunday grind.**  
Today I:  
- Solved the LeetCode POTD  
- Revised Binary Trees  
- Attended a live class on Solana token programs, clusters, accounts on solana, data model on solana, etc 

Not gonna lie, I felt a bit overwhelmed with all the jargon and how everything works.
I thought I’d be able to write about what I learned today, but I don’t feel like I’ve built a solid understanding yet.

So I’ll revise it, experiment with it, and explain it properly later once things are clearer.
