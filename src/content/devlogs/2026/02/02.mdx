Skipped College!
But the day was productive overall, did
- Leetcode POTD, and revised an old problem
- Continued learning Rust, and covered collections - Vectors and HashMaps
- Read about compiler design
- Worked on Casedock 
- Added syntax highlighting for the code snippets for this platform.


## What I learned?

### Collections in Rust

***<u>[github-repo](https://github.com/utkarsh-saxena271/rust-dev-lab/tree/main/rust-collections)</u>***

Rust standard library has a number of data structures called collections, they can contain multiple values.
The data these collections point to are stored on the heap, i.e., they store dynamic data!

#### Vectors
Vectors are data structures like arrays, but dynamic, their size can grow or shrink. Just like the vectors in C++.

```rust
fn main() {
    // vectors
    let mut vec = Vec::new();
    vec.push(10);
    vec.push(20);
    vec.push(30);
    vec.push(40);
    println!("{:?}",vec)
}
```

#### HashMaps
Hashmaps store values in key value pairs, just like objects in JavaScript or dictionaries in Python.
Common methods - insert, get, remove, clear

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    // hashmaps
    let mut hash_map = HashMap :: new();
    hash_map.insert(String::from("utkarsh"), 20);
    println!("{:?}",hash_map);

}
```
