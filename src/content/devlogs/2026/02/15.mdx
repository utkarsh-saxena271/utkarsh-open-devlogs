**Sunday grind. Not very productive because half of the day went into random chores**  
Today I:  
- Solved the LeetCode POTD  
- Learned linked lists
- Solved 3 additional linked list problems on LeetCode
- Attended a live class on System program, Token program and Solana CLI, etc 

Not gonna lie, I felt a bit overwhelmed with all the jargon and how everything works.
I thought I’d be able to write about what I learned today, but I don’t feel like I’ve built a solid understanding yet.

So I’ll revise it, experiment with it, and explain it properly later once things are clearer.
