**Had college from 8am to 4pm — most of the day went there.**  
Because of that, I didn’t get much focused time to work on personal stuff.

Today I:  
- Solved **3 LeetCode problems** (including the POTD)  
- Wrote some **college practicals**  

Didn’t really dive deep into any one specific topic today, so there’s nothing technical to explain in detail.  
Overall, it felt like a low-output day, but I still managed to show up and do something.

Tomorrow, the goal is to get back into deeper work and learning.  
See y’all in the next one.
