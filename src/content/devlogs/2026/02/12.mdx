Skipped college.  
The day was productive overall. I:  
- Solved the LeetCode POTD  
- Finally started working on my portfolio  
- Spent time figuring things out  


**Didn’t learn any one specific topic deeply today, so nothing to explain in detail. It was a more of a building day. See y’all in the next one.**
