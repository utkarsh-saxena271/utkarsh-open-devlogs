Had college from 8am to 4pm!  
The day was mid overall. I:  
- Solved the LeetCode POTD  
- Read about compiler design  
- Worked a little on a web-based Solana wallet (moved from React to Next.js due to some React pitfalls)  
- Attended a live class on Classes and Promises at the 100xDevs Bootcamp  

**Didn’t learn any one specific topic deeply today, so nothing to explain in detail. It was a pretty basic day. See y’all in the next one.**
