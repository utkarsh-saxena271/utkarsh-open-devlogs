Had college from 8am to 4pm!  
The day was mid overall. I:  
- Solved the LeetCode POTD and a additional problem
- Attended live class on **Promises** in the live bootcamp
- Worked a little bit on my portfolio

**Didn’t learn any one specific topic deeply today, so nothing to explain in detail. It was a pretty basic day. See y’all in the next one.**
