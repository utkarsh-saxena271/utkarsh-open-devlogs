**Sunday grind. The day was good overall!**  
Today I:  
- Solved **4 LeetCode problems** (including the POTD)  
- Wrote 21 February’s devlog, including Docker Layers, Networks, and Volumes  
- Studied a little bit of Compiler Design (basics)  
- Attended live lecture on **Token Programs in Solana** at the cohort  

Today's log is short, but it took a lot of time and energy to write yesterday’s log and explain all the Docker concepts. Would love it if you gave it a read: <u>***<Link href='./21'>21 February</Link>***</u>

Nothing new learned today, so keeping it short. See you in the next one!
