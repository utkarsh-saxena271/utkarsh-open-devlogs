**Had college from 8am to 4pm — most of the day was spent there.**

Today I:  
- Solved **3 LeetCode problems** (including the POTD)
- Attended live lecture on **Sorting and Searching** at the cohort. 

Didn’t really dive deep into any one specific topic today, so there’s nothing technical to explain in detail.  
Overall, it felt like a normal day, but I still managed to show up and do something.

See y’all in the next one.
