**Skipped the University Annual Event (Day 1). The day was very productive overall!**  
Today I:  
- Solved **10 LeetCode problems** (including the POTD)  
- Learned Docker Compose — I’ll explain it in detail in the next devlog  
- Wrote a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml for a dummy Express + PostgreSQL + Prisma app  

The day turned out to be really productive after skipping the event.  
See you in the next one!
