Had college from 8am to 4pm!  
The day was mid overall. I:  
- Solved the LeetCode POTD   
- Revised some React topics

Missed devlogs for the last two days because I was caught up with work, a company assessment, and some other stuff.
Will push the pending devlogs shortly.

**Didn’t learn any one specific topic deeply today, so nothing to explain in detail. It was a pretty basic day. See y’all in the next one.**
