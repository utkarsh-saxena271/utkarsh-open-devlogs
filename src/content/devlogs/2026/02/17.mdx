**Had college from 8am to 4pm — most of the day went there.**  
Because of that, today was mostly unproductive and low-energy.

Today I:  
- Solved LeetCode POTD  
- Did nothing else 

Didn’t dive deep into any one specific topic, so nothing technical to explain.  
Overall, a pretty rough, low-output and unproductive day, but at least I showed up and did something small.

Tomorrow, aiming to bounce back and focus on deeper work.  
See y’all in the next one.
