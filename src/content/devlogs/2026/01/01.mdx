## Day 7 — Devlog

## What I worked on today

Today I focused on improving my **Devlogs platform**.  
The main goal was to make the **year / month / date routing fully dynamic** and ensure MDX files render correctly.

Things I did:
- Fixed dynamic route params issues
- Cleaned up the folder structure for MDX files
- Made the sidebar navigation fully functional

---

## Key learnings

### 1. Dynamic Routes in Next.js App Router

I learned that:
- Route params can be async
- `notFound()` is the correct way to handle invalid paths
- File system checks (`fs.existsSync`) are useful for MDX-based content

```ts
if (!fs.existsSync(mdxPath)) {
  notFound()
}
